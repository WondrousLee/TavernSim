# TavernSim
Very simple Tavern Simulator system written in Java


Future roadmap (this will be updated quite requently):

[1] - in-progress
Bartering:
Roll the Bartering "dice" for Client and add additional +10-30 (also random) Dublons (money)
So there is a given number interval of money that you can get/guess for a drink from this person (Client)

[2] 
Cost of materials (so you need to pay for making drinks)
More refined value and money (balance)
How many clients per day can arrive.
And Ending day mechanic.

[3]
Tavern has reputation, (after 3-4 tries) every time you miss bartering or have random negative event you lose 1 point of reputation

Your points can affect things like:
- Cost of materials needed
- The cost you can charge for each drink
- (Possibly) Number of people in the day that you can serve (? Not sure if i'll add it right now)
- (Possibly) Chance for negative events (f.e destroyed tables etc. which again can reduce number of people in the day)

[4]
Events:
There can be positive or negative events which can give you number of things.
From resources, money, to possibly reputation

[5]
Upgrades to Tavern
More "Noble" clients which can buy more expensive drinks, more clients "per day", a way to negate negative events (like guards etc.)

[6]
Game Over:
Not yet specified.
