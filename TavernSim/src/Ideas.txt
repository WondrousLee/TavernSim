Tavern:

Tavern has reputation, (after 3-4 tries) every time you miss bartering or have random negative event you lose 1 point of reputation

Your points can affect things like:
- Cost of materials needed
- The cost you can charge for each drink
- (Possibly) Number of people in the day that you can serve (? Not sure if i'll add it right now)
- (Possibly) Chance for negative events (f.e destroyed tables etc. which again can reduce number of people in the day)


Other stats of Tavern:
- Materials - materials are needed for making drinks
- Money - of course
- (Possibly) Number of people you can serve
- (Possibly) Clean-eness of the tavern - can affect other things

Function Event Trigger:
There can be positive or negative events which can give you number of things.

Function Bartering:
Roll the Bartering "dice" for Client and add additional +10-30 (also random) Dublons (money)
So there is a given number interval of money that you can get/guess for a drink from this person (Client)

Function Game Over:
Not yet specified.
